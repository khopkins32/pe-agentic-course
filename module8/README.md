# Module 8 — Capstone: Build Your Production Platform Agent

This is the final module. You complete a real 5-step pipeline agent that diagnoses CI failures, evaluates quality gates, decides whether to auto-fix or escalate, and writes a structured post-mortem — all without human involvement.

---

## How the Capstone Works

Open `module8/platform_agent.py`. Step 1 (INGEST) is fully implemented as a worked example — read it, then complete Steps 2–5 by implementing the four TODO functions and run the full pipeline yourself.

**Budget: ~45 minutes.**

---

## The Pipeline

| Step | Function to complete | What Claude does |
|------|----------------------|------------------|
| 1 | `run_step_ingest()` | Classifies the failure event — **already done, use as your pattern** |
| 2 | `run_step_diagnose()` | Root cause analysis — confidence HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW, fix_possible true/false |
| 3 | `run_step_gate()` | Quality gate evaluation — APPROVE, APPROVE_WITH_CONDITIONS, or HOLD |
| 4 | `run_step_fix_or_escalate()` | Branching logic — AUTO_FIX or ESCALATE + save fix script if applicable |
| 5 | `generate_report()` | Post-mortem summary and prevention recommendations |

The pipeline orchestrator (`run_pipeline()`) is already wired up and calls your functions in order. Do not edit it.

## Setup

```bash
# From the repo root
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
python module1/verify_setup.py
```

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1 — Run mock mode first

Before writing any code, run the agent in mock mode to see the shape of each step's output:

```bash
python module8/platform_agent.py --simulate --mock
```

You will see five JSON blocks — INGEST, DIAGNOSE, GATE, FIX/ESCALATE, REPORT — followed by the final report and a 🔴 ESCALATION message. This is exactly what your completed functions will produce.

### Step 2 — Read the worked example

Open `platform_agent.py` and read `run_step_ingest()` carefully. Every other step follows the same three-line pattern:

```python
def run_step_ingest(event: dict) -> dict:
    return run_step("INGEST", INGEST_PROMPT, event)
```

The difference for Steps 3–6 is that you need to build a richer `context` dict that passes results from earlier steps to Claude.

### Step 3 — Complete `run_step_diagnose()`

Build a context dict that contains both the original `event` and the `ingest` result, then call `run_step()` with `DIAGNOSE_PROMPT`.

```python
def run_step_diagnose(event: dict, ingest: dict) -> dict:
    context = {
        "event":          event,
        "classification": ingest,   # gives Claude the step 1 output
    }
    return run_step("DIAGNOSE", DIAGNOSE_PROMPT, context)
```

Once you implement DIAGNOSE, remove `--mock` to verify Step 3 calls Claude correctly before continuing:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... python module8/platform_agent.py --simulate
```

### Step 4 — Complete `run_step_gate()`

Same pattern. Context combines `event` and `diagnose` result.

### Step 5 — Complete `run_step_fix_or_escalate()`

This step has the key branching logic. After calling `run_step()`:

- If `result['path'] == 'AUTO_FIX'` and `result.get('auto_fix_script')` is non-empty → call `save_fix_script(result['auto_fix_script'], pipeline_id)` and add the returned path to `result['fix_script_path']`.
- Otherwise return the result as-is (ESCALATE path).

The AUTO_FIX path only triggers when the system prompt conditions are all met (HIGH confidence + fix_possible=true + no DB migration involved). For the default `--simulate` event, the expected result is ESCALATE.

### Step 6 — Complete `generate_report()`

Build context from `pipeline_id` and the full `steps` dict, call `run_step()` with `REPORT_PROMPT`.

### Step 7 — Run the full pipeline live

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... python module8/platform_agent.py --simulate
```

All five steps should complete, each printing a JSON block. The final output will show either 🔴 ESCALATION REQUIRED or ✅ Pipeline resolved.

### Step 8 — Trigger via GitHub Actions

Push any commit to your fork to trigger the workflow manually, or use the Actions tab → "Module 8 — Capstone Agent" → "Run workflow".

The workflow also fires automatically if the `module4-broken-pipeline` workflow fails in your repo.

Check: Actions tab → select the run → verify the Step Summary tab shows the report and the artifact `module8-capstone-report` is attached.

## Your Deliverable — A 2–3 Minute Screen Recording

Record your screen while running the live pipeline. The video proves the agent ran (Claude's reasoning is visible, the pipeline_id is unique to your run) and is a portfolio artifact you can share in any engineering interview or team demo. No editing required.

**What to show in the recording:**

1. **Your code** — open `platform_agent.py` briefly and point to one completed TODO function.
2. **Mock mode** — run this so the 5-step structure is visible before the live run:
   ```bash
   python module8/platform_agent.py --simulate --mock
   ```
3. **Live run** — let all five steps stream in real time:
   ```bash
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... python module8/platform_agent.py --simulate
   ```
4. **The output file** — open `output/output_module8_platform_agent.json` and scroll through it to show Claude's verbatim reasoning for each step.
5. **GitHub Actions** — open the Actions tab in your browser and show the completed workflow run with the Step Summary visible.

## Key Takeaway

- The student skeleton is intentional. Step 1 (INGEST) is fully implemented so you can see the exact three-line pattern before writing any code yourself.
- Steps 2–5 are `raise NotImplementedError` stubs — not because the code is hard, but because writing the pattern four more times ingrains it.
- Every production platform agent you build after this course follows the same pattern: build a context dict, call Claude with a system prompt, parse structured JSON output, pass the result to the next step.
- The capstone proves you understand the pattern well enough to replicate it — not that you can write complex code.
- The recording deliverable exists for the same reason: a 2-minute video of a live pipeline run is something you can show in an interview to demonstrate you built something real.

## GitHub Actions

**Workflow file:** `.github/workflows/module8-capstone.yml`

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Workflow name | `Module 8 — Capstone Agent` |
| Trigger | Manual via Actions tab (with optional `simulate` input), **or** automatically when the "Module 4 — Broken Pipeline" workflow fails |
| Script run | `python module8/platform_agent.py --simulate` (default) or `python module8/platform_agent.py` (when `simulate=false`) |
| Output artifact | `module8-capstone-report` → `output/output_module8_platform_agent.json` |

This workflow has two trigger modes:

**Manual trigger:** Actions tab → "Module 8 — Capstone Agent" → Run workflow. You can optionally set `simulate` to `false` to run against `sample_data.json` instead of the synthetic event.

**Automatic trigger:** When the `module4-broken-pipeline` workflow in your repo fails, this workflow fires automatically — but only if the conclusion is `failure`. This connects the two workflows: Module 4 intentionally breaks, Module 8 responds. This is a realistic pattern for production incident pipelines where a CI failure triggers an autonomous diagnosis and remediation agent.

The workflow only runs when `github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'` OR `github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'failure'`. If Module 4's workflow passes (which it won't — it's intentionally broken), Module 8 does not trigger.

**Prerequisite:** Add your API key as a repository secret named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret). The workflow file must be on your default branch before it appears in the Actions tab.

## Success Criteria

- All five steps complete and print JSON to the terminal without errors.
- `output/output_module8_platform_agent.json` is written and contains all five steps plus `final_output`.
- ESCALATE path: `final_output.github_issue_title` and `github_issue_body` are non-empty strings.
- AUTO_FIX path (optional — requires editing `sample_data.json` to a HIGH confidence scenario): a fix script appears in `module8/fixes/`.
- GitHub Actions workflow completes and `module8-capstone-report` artifact is attached to the run.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`NotImplementedError: Complete run_step_diagnose()`**
You haven't implemented that step yet. Follow the pattern from `run_step_ingest()` — build a context dict and call `run_step()`.

**`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'shared'`**
Run from the repo root, not from inside `module8/`:
```bash
# Correct
python module8/platform_agent.py --mock

# Wrong
cd module8 && python platform_agent.py --mock
```

**`JSONDecodeError` in a pipeline step**
Claude returned text that wasn't valid JSON. Check the system prompt constant for that step — it must contain "Return ONLY valid JSON". You can also add `print(raw_response)` before the parse in `shared/claude_client.py` to see what Claude actually returned.

**Step 4 always takes ESCALATE even with HIGH confidence**
Check that your `run_step_fix_or_escalate()` passes the `diagnose` result in the context dict. If Claude doesn't see `fix_possible: true` and `confidence: HIGH` in the context, it will default to ESCALATE.

**GitHub Actions workflow does not appear**
The workflow file must be on your default branch. Push your changes to `main` first, then the workflow becomes available in the Actions tab.

**`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret not found in Actions**
Go to your repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret. Name it `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
